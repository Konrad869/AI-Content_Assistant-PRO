AI Content Assistant PRO is a modern web application built with Angular that simulates AI-powered text generation.
The app allows users to summarize or rewrite text in different styles — formal, technical, or creative — using a mocked AI integration (no API keys required).
It demonstrates how a frontend developer can build a realistic AI interface, with asynchronous logic, Material Design components, and a clean user experience.

Users can:

Paste any text into the input field

Choose a writing style

Click "Process" to generate the result

View simulated AI output with a loading spinner

Copy the generated result

Browse history of recent queries (stored in localStorage)
